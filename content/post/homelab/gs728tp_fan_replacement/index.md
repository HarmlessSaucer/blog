## Overview

As part of the new setup for our home network, I wired in a few cameras, added multiple Ubiquiti UniFi access points and switches.  In our old house we used a lot fewer PoE devices, so I got away with using some cheap TP-Link or Netgear PoE switches from Amazon for around £30-40.  These generally only had about 5 PoE ports.

Since I needed a lot more, I decided to start looking for larger, rack mount PoE switches.  I knew Ubiuqiti UniFi stuff would be out of my price range, but I wasn't expecting the jump from something 5 port to 8 port to then 16 ports to be so huge!

I ended up checking out old enterprise network gear and settled on a __Netgear Prosafe GS728TP__ I found on eBay for around __£70__ delivered which I thought was a great price for a managed 24 port PoE switch.

It's been working great but the fans are definitely _loud_.  Since it's in our "garage" (data center) it's not too bad but they really do sound like they could be on their last legs, so I started to take a look into replacement.


## Replacement Kits on eBay

I started looking into if I could find replacement fans on eBay.  I found a few listings that were for my model, but they were super expensive - __£70+!__  This just seemed nuts for a tiny fan that probably costs a couple of dollars!

Doing a bit of sleuthing, I tried to look at the pictures in the eBay listings to see if I could see the fan models to buy them elsewhere.  However the listing creators had blurred out the text in the images!  Cheeky.

I did notice however, one of the fans in the replacement eBay item has the code, __"f4509f"__ written on it that didn't get blurred.

Looking this up on Google shows a result:
