Hey! I'm Graham, an IT Profesaaasional based in Berkshire, UK.

I'm passionate about home automation, Linux, Open Source software and self-hosting.  I also love DIY, electronics and making music.

I make notes for myself in Markdown, so I figured I'd share the odd blog post about things I'm doing, mainly so I can look it up later when I forget!  If it helps anyone else out, bonus!
